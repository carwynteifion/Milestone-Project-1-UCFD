## User Experience
- User stories
  - First Time Visitor Goals
    
    a. As a first time visitor, I want to understand the site's purpose so I can determine if it is relevant to what I need.

    b. As a first time visitor, I want to learn about the courses on offer so I can make an informed choice on which is best suited to me.

    c. As a first time visitor, I want to easily navigate through the site so I can find the information and content I need.

    d. As a first time visitor, I want to read some testimonials so I can determine if the organisation is trustworthy.

  - Returning Visitor Goals

    a. As a returning visitor, I want to contact the organisation easily, be it through a contact form or social media, so I can enquire for further details.

    b. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to easily sign up to the course that best fits my level of skill, so I can be emailed about a particular course's details.

  - Frequent Visitor Goals
    
    a. As a frequent visitor, I want to sign up to more advanced courses, so I can progress in my learning.

- Design
  - Colour Scheme
    - The main colours used are light green and white text, with yellow accents. These are used to blend with the colours of the hero image and to strengthen the connection with Wales, as the Welsh flag incorporates white and green. Sections using a white background and black text are used to aid in clearly separating areas of content.
  - Typography
    - The main font used throughout the site is Exo, with Sans Serif used as a fallback. Exo is used as it is stylish, easily readable and conveys a feeling of progress.
    - Noto Sans JP is used for the site's title in the navbar, again with Sans Serif as a fallback. Noto Sans JP has more of a formal style while remaining easily readable. 
  - Imagery
    - I have used a hero image of close-up daffodils to emphasise the Welsh theme. Yellow catches the attention of the user amidst the mainly green theme, and has an association with confidence, friendliness, and creativity.

### Testing User Stories from UX Section

  - First Time Visitor Goals
    
    - a. As a first time visitor, I want to understand the site's purpose so I can determine if it is relevant to what I need.

      - i. The home page greets users with a navigation bar that is clear and easy to read, so that they may navigate to the page they require. Underneath the navigation bar is a hero image with text and a "Choose a course" call to action button.

      - ii. The hero image is of daffodils; their traditional association with Wales and their status as Wales' national flower match up with the site's purpose of getting prospective students to sign up to a Welsh language course.
      <h2 align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/cvhVTrW/screenshot1.png"></h2>

      - iii. From the home page, the user can click the call to action button, choose an option from the navigation bar, or scroll down to reveal more information. At the bottom of the page is a sign-up form, as well as a smaller redirection call to action to invite the user to browse courses if they do not want to sign up just yet.
      <h2 align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/NYv2DrK/screenshot2.png"></h2>

    - b. As a first time visitor, I want to learn about the courses on offer so I can make an informed choice on which is best suited to me.

      - i. The navigation bar includes a clear link to the courses page, accessed by clicking on "Our Courses".

      - ii. The call to action button invites the user to choose a course. It is clear and centre-aligned within the hero image.

      - iii. At the bottom of the page is another smaller redirect call to action inviting the user to choose a course, having read more of the home page's content and deciding not to sign up yet.

      - iv. The "Our Courses" page provides clear guidance on each course. Content is clearly separated with accompanying headings to denote which course each paragraph is referring to. 
      <h2 align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Wgyt58q/screenshot4.png"></h2>

      - v. Once the user has made a choice, they can sign up using the form found at the bottom of each page, or use the contact form on the "Contact Us" page for more information.
      <h2 align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/MNyxvpL/screenshot5.png"></h2>

    - c. As a first time visitor, I want to easily navigate through the site so I can find the information and content I need.

      - i. The site is designed transparently so the user is never lost while browsing. The current page is denoted by its corresponding navigation bar link being lighter than the others, clearly showing the user where they are on the site. The navigation bar is present on each page with links succinctly describing where the user will end up when they click on the link.

      - ii. At the bottom of each page is a redirection call to action. This makes sure the user can continue to browse the site instead of feeling like there is no further content once reaching the bottom of a page.

    - d. As a first time visitor, I want to read some testimonials so I can determine if the organisation is trustworthy.

      - i. After scrolling past the hero image and "Why Learn Welsh" sections, the user will notice the "Testimonials" section.
      <h2 align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/mt1d74Q/screenshot6.png"></h2>

      - ii. Social media links are included in the footer of each page.

      - iii. The user can also use the "Contact Us" page to send any queries to the organisation via the form.

  - Returning Visitor Goals

    - a. As a returning visitor, I want to contact the organisation easily, be it through a contact form or social media, so I can enquire for further details.

      - i. There is a clear link to the "Contact Us" page in the navigation bar. Here the user can send any queries they may have to the organisation directly.

      - ii. There are also links in the footer to the organisation's Facebook and Twitter pages so the user may use those as a point of contact.

      - iii. If the user clicks either social media link, the resulting page will open in a new tab so the user can return to the site later.

    - b. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to easily sign up to the course that best fits my level of skill, so I can be emailed about a particular course's details.

      - i. The user can easily return to the courses page should they need to have another look at the course that best suits them, either via the "Our Courses" link in the navbar, the "Choose a course" call to action button or the redirection call to action at the bottom of the home page. The sign-up form can be found in the footer of each page, with fields for the user's name, email address and the course they wish to sign up to.

  - Frequent Visitor Goals
    
    - a. As a frequent visitor, I want to sign up to more advanced courses, so I can progress in my learning.

      - i. The sign-up form at the bottom of each page can be used to sign up for each progressive course, as it includes a drop-down field to choose which course to sign up to.
      <h2 align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/qd4LndZ/screenshot7.png"></h2>

### Further Testing
The site has been tested on Chrome, Edge, Firefox and DuckDuckGo on mobile, desktop and tablet devices of varying screen widths.

Pages all link to each other without issue, and external links open a new tab as expected.

Family also assisted in testing the site, and reported no major issues.

### Known Bugs
- Known bugs fixed - see below.

### Fixed Bugs
- White line down the right-hand-side of the page no longer appears having applied `html, body, nav {overflow-x: hidden;}` in the CSS.

- Images in the testimonial section now align properly on smaller screen sizes after applying appropriate responsive Bootstrap grid classes to the image columns in the HTML, and applying `.image {width: 100%; max-width: 200px;}` in the CSS.

- Elements within the contact form on the Contact Us page now remain consistent across all major screen sizes after applying `<br>` after each `<input>` and the `<textarea>` in the HTML.

- Navbar content overflow was fixed by making the navbar collapsible and adding a hamburger icon in the HTML.

- Hamburger icon no longer folds to next line on screen widths lower than 316px. This was fixed by applying a lower default font size in CSS from 20px to 16px, and readjusting to 20px with a `min-width` media query.

- Footer labels and inputs are now grouped in Bootstrap `form-group` classes to prevent labels and inputs folding underneath each other one at a time.

- White space removed at bottom of contact and courses pages with Bootstrap flex classes.
