- Design
  - Colour Scheme
    - The main colours used are light green for the backgrounds (bg-success) and white text, with yellow accents. These are used to blend with the colours of the hero image and to strengthen the connection with Wales, as the Welsh flag incorporates white and green.
  - Typography
    - The main font used throughout the site is Exo, with Sans Serif used as a fallback. Exo is used as it is stylish, easily readable and conveys a feeling of progress.
    - Noto Sans JP is used for the site's title in the navbar, again with Sans Serif as a fallback. Noto Sans JP has more of a formal style while remaining easily readable. 
  - Imagery
    - I have used a hero image of close-up daffodils to emphasise the Welsh theme. Yellow catches the attention of the user, being one of the most attractive colours to the eye, and has an association with confidence, friendliness, and creativity.
